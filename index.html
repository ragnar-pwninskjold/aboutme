  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>I currently do market access consulting for biopharmaceutical companies.
   I'm excited to learn at Thinkful so that I can bring web application ideas to life. 
    My dream is to own a space-mining company.</p>
  <p> I think the right to exercising the freedom of ideas is essential to the prosperity of
   the human race. 
    <br></br>
    Businesses that can properly leverage new technologies in a profitable
   way have the potential to dramatically change the world and this is something
   we should all strive to do as individuals. </p>
